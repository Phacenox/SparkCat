# SparkCat
## Able to teleport short distances by expending bursts of energy; this electric slugcat can outmaneuver almost any creature.

### Features
 - A Teleporting Dash: Press jump and grab at the same time to perform a near instantaneous zip through the air.
	* Zips can be recharged at a cost of 6 to one food pip, by holding no direction in certain states (eg. crawling, pole climbing).
 - Electric Crafting Recipies: Rubbish and spears found around the world can be charged, for a cost.
	* Press and hold grab to charge an electric spear or piece of rubbish, or to consume its charge to replenish zips.
	* Press and hold grab and up while holding an electrified rubbish and a spear to craft an electric spear.

### Notes
This mod is in early development.

Note that its dependency, Electric Rubbish, will alter other slugcat's campaigns. Options to change this will be added in the future.

I intend to add a custom region and campaign in the future, but no promises.
